# XKCD-Installer
u/soggyDoggies747's XKCD program. Installs almost every comic on your desktop and its alt-text.
Programmed using Python and compiled to .exe using pyinstaller.

XKCD-Installer JSON Edition introduces several new features (date of comic, transcript, alt-titles, text documents dedicated to transcript/alt-titles). Requires a stronger computer versus the original edition.
Thank you is underway for u/CraigularB for bringing to attention the JSON interface that made these new additions possible.
